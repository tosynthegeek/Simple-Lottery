# **Simple-Lottery**

Created a simple lottery contract using a pseudo-algorithm to generate random numbers. Since we can directly generate random numbers in Solidity, we would use a pseudo-algorithm to generate a random number, which would be used as an index to select the lottery winner from the array of players.

## Features

1. Players enter the lottery with a fee of ^0.1ether
2. Check the current balance of funds in the contract
3. Players the current players in the lottery
4. Generate a random number using a pseudo-algorithm
5. Pick a winner using the random number generated
